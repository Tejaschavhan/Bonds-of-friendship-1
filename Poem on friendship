In the garden of life, a friendship blooms,
 A comforting embrace, like soft moonlit plumes.
  Through trials and joys, hand in hand they stride,
   In each other's presence, hearts open wide.
    A tapestry woven with memories so sweet,
     In this timeless bond, two souls meet and greet.
--
Friendship, a bond so true and rare,
Through highs and lows, they always care.
With laughter shared and shoulders to lean,
In each other's hearts, forever seen.
